# Keep (Clone)

Quickly capture what's on your mind and get a reminder later at the right place or time. Speak a voice memo on the go and have it automatically transcribed. Grab a photo of a poster, receipt or document and easily organise or find it later in search. Google Keep makes it easy to capture a thought or list for yourself and share it with friends and family.

**Capture what's on your mind**

• Add notes, lists and photos to Google Keep. Pressed for time? Record a voice memo and Keep will transcribe it so you can find it later.

• Take advantage of widgets on your phone and tablet and add tiles and complications to your Wear OS device to quickly capture your thoughts.

**Share ideas with friends and family**

• Easily plan that surprise party by sharing your Keep notes with others and collaborating on them in real time.
